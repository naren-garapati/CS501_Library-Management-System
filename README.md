This is a basic library management system designed with the use of java. Functionality can be expanded upon. This was the final project for the Introduction to Java class at Drexel University. 

The main file is run using LibraryMain. It makes use of a parent abstract class from which DVDs, newspapers, and books are derived from. There is a data catalog manager that reads in input from files to show users what kind of options are available. A user can interact with a menu to decide whatkind of options they want to perform.
